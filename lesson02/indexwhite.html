			<h1>White Space</h1>
			<p>In essence, whitespace is the unused space within an image, it can be intentional,
                or unintentional, it can affect an image for better or for worse. My favorite way to 
                effectively use white space is by justifying text, which cuts the line off at the same point
                of every sentence. There are 4 ways to use white space, that consists of:macro, micro, passive, and active.
            </p>
            <h2>Macro white space</h2>
            <p>Macro white space is kind of like the white space in the bigger picture, as opposed to how it is
                handled in a certain space. Think of it as bigger, more visible differences than micro white space.
                this includes: space between the header and images, padding, and margin, and more.
            </p>
            <h2>Micro white space</h2>
            <p>Micro white space is basically the space that is more subtle. The justification of this text is a really good 
                example of this. The spacing between words, or how far an image is from the text are good examples of this.
            </p>
            <h2>Passive & Active white space</h2>
            <p>Active white space is used to make people look at an image, or to provide emphasis on something else. 
                Passive white space is used to make the text easier to read, justification, using easy to read fonts,
                and spacing are good examples of passive white spacing.
